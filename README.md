For each of the experiments, all the code needed to replicate it could be found inside each of the experimental folders. Note that to run the code, it must be brought out to the main folder so that it is able to call upon the util files to run properly. 

Experiments were ran on a HPC with varying configurations, and when possible, the experiments will load all the images to ram/vram. GPUs used are partitions of NVIDIA A100s.
